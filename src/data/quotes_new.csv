397,,"“Only once in your life, I truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. You tell them things that you’ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful happens, you can’t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid it’s like being young again. Colours seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didn’t exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long day’s work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, there’s no need for continuous conversation, but you find you’re quite content in just having them nearby. Things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that there’s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that’s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life.”

You see that weird chick sniffing the pages of an old book in a secondhand book shop? That’s the reader. They can never resist smelling the pages, especially when they are yellow and worn.

She’s the girl reading while waiting in that coffee shop down the street. If you take a peek at her mug, the non-dairy creamer is floating on top because she’s kind of engrossed already. Lost in a world of the author’s making. Sit down. She might give you a glare, as most girls who read do not like to be interrupted. Ask her if she likes the book.

Buy her another cup of coffee.

Let her know what you really think of Murakami. See if she got through the first chapter of Fellowship. Understand that if she says she understood James Joyce’s Ulysses she’s just saying that to sound intelligent. Ask her if she loves Alice or she would like to be Alice.

It’s easy to date a girl who reads. Give her books for her birthday, for Christmas, for anniversaries. Give her the gift of words, in poetry and in song. Give her Neruda, Pound, Sexton, Cummings. Let her know that you understand that words are love. Understand that she knows the difference between books and reality but by god, she’s going to try to make her life a little like her favorite book. It will never be your fault if she does.

She has to give it a shot somehow.

Lie to her. If she understands syntax, she will understand your need to lie. Behind words are other things: motivation, value, nuance, dialogue. It will not be the end of the world.

Fail her. Because a girl who reads knows that failure always leads up to the climax. Because girls who read understand that all things must come to end, but that you can always write a sequel. That you can begin again and again and still be the hero. That life is meant to have a villain or two.

Why be frightened of everything that you are not? Girls who read understand that people, like characters, develop. Except in the Twilight series.

If you find a girl who reads, keep her close. When you find her up at 2 AM clutching a book to her chest and weeping, make her a cup of tea and hold her. You may lose her for a couple of hours but she will always come back to you. She’ll talk as if the characters in the book are real, because for a while, they always are.

You will propose on a hot air balloon. Or during a rock concert. Or very casually next time she’s sick. Over Skype.

You will smile so hard you will wonder why your heart hasn’t burst and bled out all over your chest yet. You will write the story of your lives, have kids with strange names and even stranger tastes. She will introduce your children to the Cat in the Hat and Aslan, maybe in the same day. You will walk the winters of your old age together and she will recite Keats under her breath while you shake the snow off your boots.

Date a girl who reads because you deserve it. You deserve a girl who can give you the most colorful life imaginable. If you can only give her monotony, and stale hours and half-baked proposals, then you’re better off alone. If you want the world and the worlds beyond it, date a girl who reads.

Or better yet, date a girl who writes.”

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.”

To be just as enthusiastic about the success of others
as you are about your own.

To forget the mistakes of the past
and press on to the greater achievements of the future.
To wear a cheerful countenance at all times
and give every living creature you meet a smile.

To give so much time to the improvement of yourself
that you have no time to criticize others.
To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear,
and too happy to permit the presence of trouble.

To think well of yourself and to proclaim this fact to the world,
not in loud words but great deeds.
To live in faith that the whole world is on your side

I believe that the future sucks and I believe that the future rocks and I believe that one day White Buffalo Woman is going to come back and kick everyone's ass. I believe that all men are just overgrown boys with deep problems communicating and that the decline in good sex in America is coincident with the decline in drive-in movie theaters from state to state. I believe that all politicians are unprincipled crooks and I still believe that they are better than the alternative. I believe that California is going to sink into the sea when the big one comes, while Florida is going to dissolve into madness and alligators and toxic waste. I believe that antibacterial soap is destroying our resistance to dirt and disease so that one day we'll all be wiped out by the common cold like martians in War of the Worlds. I believe that the greatest poets of the last century were Edith Sitwell and Don Marquis, that jade is dried dragon sperm, and that thousands of years ago in a former life I was a one-armed Siberian shaman. I believe that mankind's destiny lies in the stars. I believe that candy really did taste better when I was a kid, that it's aerodynamically impossible for a bumble bee to fly, that light is a wave and a particle, that there's a cat in a box somewhere who's alive and dead at the same time (although if they don't ever open the box to feed it it'll eventually just be two different kinds of dead), and that there are stars in the universe billions of years older than the universe itself. I believe in a personal god who cares about me and worries and oversees everything I do. I believe in an impersonal god who set the universe in motion and went off to hang with her girlfriends and doesn't even know that I'm alive. I believe in an empty and godless universe of causal chaos, background noise, and sheer blind luck. I believe that anyone who says sex is overrated just hasn't done it properly. I believe that anyone who claims to know what's going on will lie about the little things too. I believe in absolute honesty and sensible social lies. I believe in a woman's right to choose, a baby's right to live, that while all human life is sacred there's nothing wrong with the death penalty if you can trust the legal system implicitly, and that no one but a moron would ever trust the legal system. I believe that life is a game, that life is a cruel joke, and that life is what happens when you're alive and that you might as well lie back and enjoy it.”

Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.”

1199,,"“The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.”

She’s a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she’s hosting the world’s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the Cool Girl.Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they’re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men – friends, coworkers, strangers – giddy over these awful pretender women, and I’d want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who’d like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. I’d want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesn’t really love chili dogs that much – no one loves chili dogs that much! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: They’re not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, they’re pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. Oh, and if you’re not a Cool Girl, I beg you not to believe that your man doesn’t want the Cool Girl. It may be a slightly different version – maybe he’s a vegetarian, so Cool Girl loves seitan and is great with dogs; or maybe he’s a hipster artist, so Cool Girl is a tattooed, bespectacled nerd who loves comics. There are variations to the window dressing, but believe me, he wants Cool Girl, who is basically the girl who likes every fucking thing he likes and doesn’t ever complain. (How do you know you’re not Cool Girl? Because he says things like: “I like strong women.” If he says that to you, he will at some point fuck someone else. Because “I like strong women” is code for “I hate strong women.”)”

1341,“有时候，命运就像一场不断改变方向的小沙尘暴。你改变了方向，但沙尘暴追上了你。你再次转身，但风暴会调整。你一次又一次地玩这个游戏，就像黎明前与死亡共舞的不祥之舞。为什么？因为这场风暴不是从远处吹来的，与你无关。这场风暴就是你。你的一些东西。所以你所能做的就是屈服于它，走进风暴之中，闭上眼睛，堵住耳朵，这样沙子就不会进来，一步一步地穿过它。那里没有太阳，没有月亮，没有方向，没有时间感。只是细小的白沙像粉碎的骨头一样盘旋着飞向天空。这就是你需要想象的沙尘暴。你真的必须穿过那场暴力的、形而上学的、象征性的风暴。无论它有多么形而上学或象征性，都不要搞错：它会像一千把剃须刀片一样割破肉。人们会在那里流血，也会流血。热血沸腾。你会在你的手上沾到血，你自己的血和别人的血。一旦风暴过去，你就不会记得你是如何度过的，你是如何幸存下来的。事实上，你甚至不确定风暴是否真的结束了。但有一件事是肯定的。当你走出风暴时，你将不再是那个走进来的人。这就是这场风暴的意义所在。”,"“Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn't something that blew in from far away, something that has nothing to do with you. This storm is you. Something  of you. So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm, closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so the sand doesn't get in, and walk through it, step by step. There's no sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time. Just fine white sand swirling up into the sky like pulverized bones. That's the kind of sandstorm you need to imagine.And you really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical, symbolic storm. No matter how metaphysical or symbolic it might be, make no mistake about it: it will cut through flesh like a thousand razor blades. People will bleed there, and  will bleed too. Hot, red blood. You'll catch that blood in your hands, your own blood and the blood of others.And once the storm is over you won't remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won't even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won't be the same person who walked in. That's what this storm's all about.”

1445,“对我来说，树木一直是最有穿透力的传教士。当它们生活在部落和家庭中，在森林和小树林中时，我尊敬它们。当它们独自站立时，我更尊敬它们。它们就像孤独的人。它们不像因某种软弱而偷走的隐士，而是像贝多芬和尼采这样伟大而孤独的男人。在它们最高的树枝上，世界沙沙作响，它们的根扎根于无限；但它们不会迷失在那里，它们只为一件事而奋斗：根据自己的法律实现自己，建立自己的形式，代表自己。没有什么比一棵美丽、强壮的树更神圣、更模范的了。当一棵树被砍倒，在阳光下暴露出它赤裸裸的死亡伤口时，人们可以在它树干上闪闪发光的刻字盘上阅读它的整个历史：在它的年轮中，它的伤痕，所有的挣扎，所有的痛苦，所有的疾病，所有的幸福和繁荣都真实地书写着，狭窄的岁月和奢华的岁月，经受住的攻击，忍受的风暴。每个年轻的农家男孩都知道，最坚硬、最高贵的木头有最窄的年轮，在高山上，在持续的危险中，最坚不可摧、最强壮、最理想的树木会生长。树木是避难所。谁知道如何与他们交谈，谁知道如何倾听他们，谁就能了解真相。他们不宣扬学问和戒律，他们不受细节的阻碍，宣扬古老的生命法则。一棵树说：一颗内核藏在我里面，一个火花，一个念头，我是永生中的生命。永恒的母亲和我一起经历的尝试和风险是独一无二的，我皮肤的形状和纹理是独一无二的、树枝上最小的叶子和树皮上最小的疤痕是独一无二的。我被造是为了在我最小的特殊细节中形成和揭示永恒。一棵树说：我的力量是信任。我对我的父亲一无所知，我对每年从我身上生出的一千个孩子一无所知。我把种子的秘密一直活到最后，我不关心其他任何事情。我相信上帝在我里面。我相信我的劳动是神圣的。我生活在这种信任之中。当我们遭受重创，无法再忍受生命时，一棵树会对我们说：安静！别动！看着我！生活不容易，生活不难。这些都是幼稚的想法。让上帝在你内心说话，你的思想就会变得沉默。你很焦虑，因为你的路远离了母亲和家。但每一步，每一天，都会让你再次回到母亲身边。家既不在这里也不在那里。家就在你的内心，或者家根本就不在任何地方。傍晚，当我听到树木在风中沙沙作响时，我渴望漫步，泪水夺眶而出。如果一个人长时间地静静地听他们说话，这种渴望就会揭示出它的核心，它的意义。这与其说是逃离痛苦的问题，尽管看起来是这样。这是对家的渴望，对母亲的怀念，对生活的新隐喻。它带你回家。每条路都是回家的路，每一步都是出生，每一步骤都是死亡，每一个坟墓都是母亲。所以，当我们站在自己幼稚的思绪前不安时，树在傍晚沙沙作响：树有长长的思绪、长长的呼吸和宁静，就像它们比我们的寿命更长一样。只要我们不听他们的话，他们就比我们聪明。但当我们学会了如何倾听树木的声音时，我们思想的简洁、敏捷和孩子般的急躁就会带来无与伦比的快乐。谁学会了倾听树木的声音，谁就不想再成为一棵树。他只想做自己，那就是家。这就是幸福”,"“For me, trees have always been the most penetrating preachers. I revere them when they live in tribes and families, in forests and groves. And even more I revere them when they stand alone. They are like lonely persons. Not like hermits who have stolen away out of some weakness, but like great, solitary men, like Beethoven and Nietzsche. In their highest boughs the world rustles, their roots rest in infinity; but they do not lose themselves there, they struggle with all the force of their lives for one thing only: to fulfil themselves according to their own laws, to build up their own form, to represent themselves. Nothing is holier, nothing is more exemplary than a beautiful, strong tree. When a tree is cut down and reveals its naked death-wound to the sun, one can read its whole history in the luminous, inscribed disk of its trunk: in the rings of its years, its scars, all the struggle, all the suffering, all the sickness, all the happiness and prosperity stand truly written, the narrow years and the luxurious years, the attacks withstood, the storms endured. And every young farmboy knows that the hardest and noblest wood has the narrowest rings, that high on the mountains and in continuing danger the most indestructible, the strongest, the ideal trees grow. Trees are sanctuaries. Whoever knows how to speak to them, whoever knows how to listen to them, can learn the truth. They do not preach learning and precepts, they preach, undeterred by particulars, the ancient law of life. A tree says: A kernel is hidden in me, a spark, a thought, I am life from eternal life. The attempt and the risk that the eternal mother took with me is unique, unique the form and veins of my skin, unique the smallest play of leaves in my branches and the smallest scar on my bark. I was made to form and reveal the eternal in my smallest special detail. A tree says: My strength is trust. I know nothing about my fathers, I know nothing about the thousand children that every year spring out of me. I live out the secret of my seed to the very end, and I care for nothing else. I trust that God is in me. I trust that my labor is holy. Out of this trust I live. When we are stricken and cannot bear our lives any longer, then a tree has something to say to us: Be still! Be still! Look at me! Life is not easy, life is not difficult. Those are childish thoughts. Let God speak within you, and your thoughts will grow silent. You are anxious because your path leads away from mother and home. But every step and every day lead you back again to the mother. Home is neither here nor there. Home is within you, or home is nowhere at all. A longing to wander tears my heart when I hear trees rustling in the wind at evening. If one listens to them silently for a long time, this longing reveals its kernel, its meaning. It is not so much a matter of escaping from one's suffering, though it may seem to be so. It is a longing for home, for a memory of the mother, for new metaphors for life. It leads home. Every path leads homeward, every step is birth, every step is death, every grave is mother. So the tree rustles in the evening, when we stand uneasy before our own childish thoughts: Trees have long thoughts, long-breathing and restful, just as they have longer lives than ours. They are wiser than we are, as long as we do not listen to them. But when we have learned how to listen to trees, then the brevity and the quickness and the childlike hastiness of our thoughts achieve an incomparable joy. Whoever has learned how to listen to trees no longer wants to be a tree. He wants to be nothing except what he is. That is home. That is happiness.”

That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.”

We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often.We've learned how to make a living, but not a life.

These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill. It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom. A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete...Remember, to spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not going to be around forever. Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side.Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a cent.Remember, to say, ""I love you"" to your partner and your loved ones, but most of all mean it. A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you.Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person might not be there again.

You alone have brought me to Bath. For you alone, I think and plan. Have you not seen this? Can you fail to have understood my wishes? I had not waited even these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think you must have penetrated mine. I can hardly write. I am every instant hearing something which overpowers me. You sink your voice, but I can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others. Too good, too excellent creature! You do us justice, indeed. You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men. Believe it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in F.

1924,“Clary，不管怎样，我无法忍受这枚戒指永远丢失的想法，再也无法忍受永远离开你的想法。虽然我别无选择，但至少我可以选择另一个。我把我们的家庭戒指留给你，因为你和我一样有权拥有它。我写这篇文章是看着太阳升起的。你睡着了，梦想在你不安分的眼皮后面移动。我希望我知道你在想什么。我希望能钻进你的脑海，像你一样看待世界。我希望看到你的样子。但也许我不想看到。”。也许这会让我比现在更觉得我在对你撒某种弥天大谎，我无法忍受。我属于你。你可以对我做任何你想做的事，我会让你做的。你可以问我任何问题，我都会努力让你快乐。我的心告诉我，这是我有史以来最好、最伟大的感觉。但我的头脑知道想要你不能拥有的东西和想要你不应该想要的东西之间的区别。我不应该想要你。我整夜看着你睡觉，看着月光来来往往，把它的影子黑白地投射在你的脸上。我从未见过如此美丽的事物。我想到了如果事情不同，我们本可以拥有的生活，一种今晚不是一个单一事件的生活，与其他所有真实的事情分开，而是每天晚上。但事情并没有什么不同，看着你，我总觉得我骗你爱上了我。事实上，没有人愿意大声说出来，除了我，没有人能对抗瓦伦丁。我可以像其他人一样接近他。我可以假装我想加入他，他会相信我，直到我以某种方式结束这一切的最后一刻。我有一些塞巴斯蒂安的东西；我可以追踪他到我父亲藏身的地方，这就是我要做的。所以我昨晚骗了你。我说我只想和你共度一晚。但我希望每晚都和你在一起。这就是为什么我现在必须像个懦夫一样溜出你的窗户。因为如果我不得不当着你的面告诉你这些，我无法强迫自己离开。如果你恨我，我不怪你，我希望你恨我。只要我还能做梦，我就会梦到你_杰斯”,"“Clary, Despite everything, I can't bear the thought of this ring being lost forever, any more then I can bear the thought of leaving you forever. And though I have no choice about the one, at least I can choose about the other. I'm leaving you our family ring because you have as much right to it as I do.I'm writing this watching the sun come up. You're asleep, dreams moving behind your restless eyelids. I wish I knew what you were thinking. I wish I could slip into your head and see the world the way you do. I wish I could see  the way you do. But maybe I dont want to see that. Maybe it would make me feel even more than I already do that I'm perpetuating some kind of Great Lie on you, and I couldn't stand that. I belong to you. You could do anything you wanted with me and I would let you. You could ask anything of me and I'd break myself trying to make you happy. My heart tells me this is the best and greatest feeling I have ever had. But my mind knows the difference between wanting what you can't have and wanting what you shouldn't want. And I shouldn't want you.All night I've watched you sleeping, watched the moonlight come and go, casting its shadows across your face in black and white. I've never seen anything more beautiful. I think of the life we could have had if things were different, a life where this night is not a singular event, separate from everything else that's real, but every night. But things aren't different, and I can't look at you without feeling like I've tricked you into loving me.The truth no one is willing to say out loud is that no one has a shot against Valentine but me. I can get close to him like no one else can. I can pretend I want to join him and he'll believe me, up until that last moment where I end it all, one way or another. I have something of Sebastian's; I can track him to where my father's hiding, and that's what I'm going to do. So I lied to you last night. I said I just wanted one night with you. But I want every night with you. And that's why I have to slip out of your window now, like a coward. Because if I had to tell you this to your face, I couldn't make myself go. I don't blame you if you hate me, I wish you would. As long as I can still dream, I will dream of you. _Jace”

And when it subsides, you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots have so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion, it is not the desire to mate every second minute of the day, it is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every cranny of your body. No, don't blush, I am telling you some truths. That is just being ""in love"", which any fool can do. Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident.”

1934,“也许我们的大脑所拥有的最伟大的能力是应对疼痛的能力。经典思维告诉我们大脑的四扇门，每个人都会根据自己的需要穿过。第一扇门是睡眠之门。睡眠为我们提供了远离世界及其所有痛苦的退路。睡眠标志着时间的流逝，让我们与伤害我们的事情保持距离。当一个人受伤时，他们往往会失去意识。同样，听到创伤消息的人也会经常晕倒或昏厥。这是大脑通过第一扇门来保护自己免受疼痛的方式。第二扇门是遗忘之门。有些伤口太深而无法愈合，或者太深而不能迅速愈合。此外，许多记忆只是痛苦的，而且没有治愈的方法。俗话说“时间能治愈一切伤口”是错误的。时间能治愈大多数伤口。其余的都藏在这扇门后面。第三是疯狂之门。有时候，当心灵受到如此沉重的打击时，它会隐藏在疯狂中。虽然这似乎没有好处，但它是有益的。有时候，现实只不过是痛苦，为了逃避这种痛苦，头脑必须把现实抛在脑后。最后是死亡之门。最后的手段。我们死后，没有什么能伤害我们，至少我们被告知如此。”,"“Perhaps the greatest faculty our minds possess is the ability to cope with pain. Classic thinking teaches us of the four doors of the mind, which everyone moves through according to their need.First is the door of sleep. Sleep offers us a retreat from the world and all its pain. Sleep marks passing time, giving us distance from the things that have hurt us. When a person is wounded they will often fall unconscious. Similarly, someone who hears traumatic news will often swoon or faint. This is the mind's way of protecting itself from pain by stepping through the first door.Second is the door of forgetting. Some wounds are too deep to heal, or too deep to heal quickly. In addition, many memories are simply painful, and there is no healing to be done. The saying 'time heals all wounds' is false. Time heals most wounds. The rest are hidden behind this door.Third is the door of madness. There are times when the mind is dealt such a blow it hides itself in insanity. While this may not seem beneficial, it is. There are times when reality is nothing but pain, and to escape that pain the mind must leave reality behind. Last is the door of death. The final resort. Nothing can hurt us after we are dead, or so we have been told.”

2219,“最好的幻想是用梦的语言写成的。它就像梦一样活着，比现实更真实……至少在一瞬间……我们醒来前的那个漫长的魔法时刻。幻想是银色和猩红色、靛蓝色和天蓝色，黑曜石上镶嵌着金色和青金石。现实是胶合板和塑料，用泥棕色和橄榄色装饰。幻想有哈瓦那辣椒和蜂蜜、肉桂和丁香、稀有红肉和夏天一样甜的葡萄酒的味道。现实是豆子和豆腐，最后是灰烬。现实是伯班克的条形购物中心、克利夫兰的烟囱、纽瓦克的一个停车场。幻想是米纳斯提力斯的塔楼、戈尔斯的古老石头。蒙赫斯特，卡米洛特的大厅。幻想在伊卡洛斯的翅膀上飞翔，现实在西南航空公司。为什么我们的梦想最终成真时变得如此之小？我想，我们阅读幻想是为了再次找到颜色。品尝浓郁的香料，聆听海妖的歌声。幻想中有一种古老而真实的东西，它诉说着我们内心深处的东西，诉说着一个孩子，他梦想着有一天能在黑夜的森林里狩猎，在空心山下盛宴，在奥兹国以南、香格里拉以北的某个地方找到一份永恒的爱。他们可以保住自己的天堂。当我死的时候，我宁愿去中土世界。”,"“The best fantasy is written in the language of dreams. It is alive as dreams are alive, more real than real ... for a moment at least ... that long magic moment before we wake. Fantasy is silver and scarlet, indigo and azure, obsidian veined with gold and lapis lazuli. Reality is plywood and plastic, done up in mud brown and olive drab. Fantasy tastes of habaneros and honey, cinnamon and cloves, rare red meat and wines as sweet as summer. Reality is beans and tofu, and ashes at the end. Reality is the strip malls of Burbank, the smokestacks of Cleveland, a parking garage in Newark. Fantasy is the towers of Minas Tirith, the ancient stones of Gormenghast, the halls of Camelot. Fantasy flies on the wings of Icarus, reality on Southwest Airlines. Why do our dreams become so much smaller when they finally come true? We read fantasy to find the colors again, I think. To taste strong spices and hear the songs the sirens sang. There is something old and true in fantasy that speaks to something deep within us, to the child who dreamt that one day he would hunt the forests of the night, and feast beneath the hollow hills, and find a love to last forever somewhere south of Oz and north of Shangri-La. They can keep their heaven. When I die, I'd sooner go to middle Earth.”

2537,“有一次，在一个沉闷的午夜，当我虚弱而疲惫地思考着许多古怪而奇怪的被遗忘的知识时，我点了点头，几乎要睡着了，突然传来一声轻敲，就像有人轻轻地敲我的房门。这是个客人，”我喃喃自语道，“敲我的房间门——只有这个，仅此而已。”啊，我清楚地记得那是在阴冷的十二月，每一块垂死的余烬都在地板上制造了鬼魂这里越来越少了。每一块紫色窗帘的丝绸般悲伤而不确定的沙沙声都让我感到一阵前所未有的恐怖；所以现在，为了让我的心跳停止，我站在那里重复道：有客人在我的房间门口恳求入口——有晚来的客人在我房间门口请求入口；就是这样，仅此而已。”不久，我的灵魂变得更加坚强；我说：“先生，再也不用犹豫了，夫人，我真诚地请求您的原谅；但事实是，我在打盹，你轻轻地敲着，你轻轻的敲着，敲着我的房门，我几乎不确定我听到了你的声音”——我把门打开了；——黑暗在那里，什么都没有。我站在黑暗深处凝视着，很久以来，我站在那里想，害怕，怀疑，做梦，做梦，从来没有人敢做梦；但沉默没有中断，寂静没有任何迹象，那里唯一说的话就是低声说的话，“莱诺雷？我轻声细语地说，一个回声低声回应道：“莱诺雷！”！“就这一点，仅此而已。回到房间，我的灵魂在燃烧，很快我又听到一声比以前更大的敲击声。当然，”我说，“那肯定是我窗棂上的东西：那么，让我看看那里有什么，这个神秘的探索——让我的心静一静，这个神秘探索；——这是风，仅此一点。”我打开百叶窗，这时，一阵轻佻和扑腾，一只昔日圣洁的庄严乌鸦走了进来；他一点也不恭敬；他一分钟也没停下来；但是，以主人或女士的姿态，栖息在我的房门上方——栖息在我房门上方的一尊帕拉斯半身像上——栖息着，坐着，仅此而已。然后，这只乌木鸟用它严肃而庄重的表情，把我悲伤的幻想骗到了微笑中。虽然你的头顶被剃光了，但你，”我说，“肯定没有懦弱、可怕、冷酷、古老的乌鸦从夜之海岸游荡——告诉我，你在夜之普鲁顿海岸上的高贵名字是什么！乌鸦说：“再也不要了。”。“我很惊讶这只笨拙的鸟能如此清楚地听到话语，尽管它的回答没有什么意义，也没有什么相关性；因为我们不禁同意，没有一个活着的人能在他的房门上看到鸟——在他房门上的雕塑半身像上看到鸟或野兽，名字叫“永远”,"“Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.Tis some visitor,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door — Only this, and nothing more.""Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.Eagerly I wished the morrow; — vainly I had sought to borrowFrom my books surcease of sorrow — sorrow for the lost Lenore —For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore — Nameless here for evermore.And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtainThrilled me — filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door —Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; — This it is, and nothing more.""Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,Sir,"" said I, ""or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,That I scarce was sure I heard you""— here I opened wide the door; — Darkness there, and nothing more.Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ""Lenore?""This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, ""Lenore!"" — Merely this, and nothing more.Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.Surely,"" said I, ""surely that is something at my window lattice:Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore —Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; — 'Tis the wind and nothing more.""Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door —Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door — Perched, and sat, and nothing more.Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,"" I said, ""art sure no craven,Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore —Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"" Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore.""Much I marveled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,Though its answer little meaning— little relevancy bore;For we cannot help agreeing that no living human beingEver yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door —Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, With such name as ""Nevermore.”

By early afternoon he was overcome by the feeling that nothing was right, or nothing was right for him, and by the desire to be alone. By evening he was fulfilled: alone in the magnitude of his grief, alone in his aimless guilt, alone even in his loneliness.  he would repeat to himself over and over, . As if he might one day convince himself. Or fool himself. Or convince others--the only thing worse than being sad is for others to know that you are sad. Because his life had unlimited potential for happiness, insofar as it was an empty white room. He would fall asleep with his heart at the foot of his bed, like some domesticated animal that was no part of him at all. And each morning he would wake with it again in the cupboard of his rib cage, having become a little heavier, a little weaker, but still pumping.

So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservation, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. If you want to get more out of life, you must lose your inclination for monotonous security and adopt a helter-skelter style of life that will at first appear to you to be crazy.

You can't own a human being. You can't lose what you don't own. Suppose you did own him. Could you really love somebody who was absolutely nobody without you? You really want somebody like that? Somebody who falls apart when you walk out the door? You don't, do you? And neither does he. You're turning over your whole life to him. Your whole life, girl. And if it means so little to you that you can just give it away, hand it to him, then why should it mean any more to him? He can't value you more than you value yourself.”

You called a ten a nine.""But that wasn't quite right. I called it a nine because I was saving my ten.

3344,“如果我有个女儿……”她不会叫我“妈妈”，而是叫我“B点”。因为这样，她知道无论发生什么，至少她总能找到我。我要在她的手背上画太阳系，这样她就必须学习整个宇宙，然后才能说“哦，我知道这就像我的手背一样。”她会明白，生活会狠狠地打你的脸，等你站起来，这样它就会踢你的肚子。但让风从你身上吹走是提醒你的肺部有多喜欢空气味道的唯一方法。这里有伤害，无法用创可贴或诗歌来修复，所以当她第一次意识到神奇女侠不会来的时候，我会确保她知道她不必一个人穿斗篷。因为无论你把手指伸得多宽，你的手总是太小，无法承受你想要治愈的所有疼痛。相信我，我试过了。还有“宝贝，”我会告诉她“别那样高着头，我知道这个把戏，你只是在闻烟味，这样你就可以沿着小路回到一座燃烧的房子，这样你就能找到在火灾中失去一切的男孩，看看你能不能救他。否则，先找到生火的男孩，看你能不能改变他。”但我知道她无论如何都会改变的，所以我会一直在附近多放一些巧克力和雨船，因为没有巧克力不能解决的心碎。好吧，有些心碎是巧克力无法弥补的。但这就是雨靴的用途，因为如果你让雨水冲走一切。我想让她透过玻璃底船的底面看世界，透过放大镜看存在于人类心灵深处的星系。因为我妈妈就是这么教我的。会有这样的日子，“我妈妈说，”当你张开双手去抓的时候，结果只会起水泡和擦伤。当你走出电话亭试图飞翔时，你想救的人正是站在你斗篷上的人。当你的靴子里充满了雨水，你会失望地跪下，在那些日子里，你更有理由说“谢谢”，因为没有什么比大海拒绝停止亲吻海岸线的方式更美丽的了，无论它被送走了多少次。你会把“风”放在赢一些输一些上，把“星”放在一遍又一遍的开始上，无论一分钟内有多少地雷爆炸，都要确保你的头脑落在这个被称为生活的有趣地方的美丽上。是的，从一到过度信任，我非常天真，但我想让她知道这个世界是由糖组成的。它很容易碎，但不要害怕伸出舌头品尝它。“宝贝，”我会告诉她，“记住你妈妈是个多愁善感的人，但你爸爸是个战士，你是个小手大眼睛的女孩，永远不会停止要求更多。”记住，好事有三样，所以做坏事，当你做错了事时，一定要道歉，但永远不要为你的眼睛不停地发光而道歉。你的声音很小，但永远不要停止唱歌，当他们终于把心碎交给你，把仇恨和战争放在你家门口，把愤世嫉俗和失败的街角交给你时，你告诉他们他们真的应该见见你的母亲。”,"“If I should have a daughter…“Instead of “Mom”, she’s gonna call me “Point B.” Because that way, she knows that no matter what happens, at least she can always find her way to me. And I’m going to paint the solar system on the back of her hands so that she has to learn the entire universe before she can say “Oh, I know that like the back of my hand.”She’s gonna learn that this life will hit you, hard, in the face, wait for you to get back up so it can kick you in the stomach. But getting the wind knocked out of you is the only way to remind your lungs how much they like the taste of air. There is hurt, here, that cannot be fixed by band-aids or poetry, so the first time she realizes that Wonder-woman isn’t coming, I’ll make sure she knows she doesn’t have to wear the cape all by herself. Because no matter how wide you stretch your fingers, your hands will always be too small to catch all the pain you want to heal. Believe me, I’ve tried.And “Baby,” I’ll tell her “don’t keep your nose up in the air like that, I know that trick, you’re just smelling for smoke so you can follow the trail back to a burning house so you can find the boy who lost everything in the fire to see if you can save him. Or else, find the boy who lit the fire in the first place to see if you can change him.”But I know that she will anyway, so instead I’ll always keep an extra supply of chocolate and rain boats nearby, ‘cause there is no heartbreak that chocolate can’t fix. Okay, there’s a few heartbreaks chocolate can’t fix. But that’s what the rain boots are for, because rain will wash away everything if you let it.I want her to see the world through the underside of a glass bottom boat, to look through a magnifying glass at the galaxies that exist on the pin point of a human mind. Because that’s how my mom taught me. That there’ll be days like this, “There’ll be days like this my momma said” when you open your hands to catch and wind up with only blisters and bruises. When you step out of the phone booth and try to fly and the very people you wanna save are the ones standing on your cape. When your boots will fill with rain and you’ll be up to your knees in disappointment and those are the very days you have all the more reason to say “thank you,” ‘cause there is nothing more beautiful than the way the ocean refuses to stop kissing the shoreline no matter how many times it’s sent away.You will put the “wind” in win some lose some, you will put the “star” in starting over and over, and no matter how many land mines erupt in a minute be sure your mind lands on the beauty of this funny place called life.And yes, on a scale from one to over-trusting I am pretty damn naive but I want her to know that this world is made out of sugar. It can crumble so easily but don’t be afraid to stick your tongue out and taste it.“Baby,” I’ll tell her “remember your mama is a worrier but your papa is a warrior and you are the girl with small hands and big eyes who never stops asking for more.”Remember that good things come in threes and so do bad things and always apologize when you’ve done something wrong but don’t you ever apologize for the way your eyes refuse to stop shining.Your voice is small but don’t ever stop singing and when they finally hand you heartbreak, slip hatred and war under your doorstep and hand you hand-outs on street corners of cynicism and defeat, you tell them that they really ought to meet your mother.”
